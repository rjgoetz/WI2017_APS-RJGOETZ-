## Technologies:
* PHP
* MySQL
* WordPress
* Laravel

In this studio class, I plan to learn PHP and MySQL by walking through the "Head First PHP & MySQL" book. Then, I would like to dabble with WordPress customization and learning the Laravel framework. As a potential capstone project, I would like to create a "Babysit" application that helps connect parents and babysitters in their area.
