In this studio class, I plan to learn PHP and MySQL by walking through the "Head First PHP & MySQL" book. Then I will dedicate a couple weeks for learning the Laravel framework. As a capstone project, I would like to create a "Babysit" application that helps connect parents with babysitters in their area.
